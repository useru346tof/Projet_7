# Projet_7
To run this project, the important part is to run the app main.py.
This app load the model previously created, and then you can locally use and run the treamlit_app.py and connect it to the url of the main app to test it.
It will then return for a given id some key data of the given test client alongside with the status for the credit. either approved or refused with the probability that was found by the model, and the threshold found in the optimization.
